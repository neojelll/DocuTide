# DocuTide Code of Conduct

Hey there! Thanks for being part of the DocuTide community. We aim to create a space where everyone feels comfortable and can share ideas freely. Here are a few simple guidelines to help us maintain a friendly atmosphere:

## Be Kind and Respectful

- **Listen and consider others' opinions**: Everyone has their own perspective, and that's awesome! Let's respect our differences and learn from each other.
- **Be patient**: If something's unclear or raises questions, feel free to ask. We're all here to help.

## Avoid Negativity

- **No insults**: Let's keep it civil and steer clear of personal attacks. We're all adults here.
- **Constructive criticism**: If something doesn't sit right with you, suggest how it can be improved. Together, we're stronger!

## Keep It Safe

- **Personal information**: Don't share others' personal details without their consent. Respect privacy.
- **Report issues**: If you notice something odd or uncomfortable, let us know. We'll look into it and take action.

**Thanks for helping make DocuTide awesome!**
